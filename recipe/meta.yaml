  summary: 'Standalone Python wrapper for the RRTMG radiation modules'
  description: |
    climlab-rrtmg makes the RRTMG_LW and RRTMG_SW radiation codes callable
    from Python by wrapping using f2py. This is a lightweight wrapper that
    emulates the Fortran interface as closely as possible. The primary use case
    is to drive the RRTMG radiation processes in climlab, but it can be used as
    a standalone driver if you are familiar with the RRTMG Fortran interface.
